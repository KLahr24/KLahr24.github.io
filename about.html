        <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Katlin Lahr, a passionate junior at Kennesaw State University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Technology. Currently, I thrive as the Data Management Supervisor at the Department of Public Health (DPH), where I find immense joy in managing and organizing data effectively.</p>

    <p>Outside the realm of work and academia, I cherish moments spent with my family, creating lasting memories. I am also lucky to share a happy and fulfilling relationship with the man I love. Together, we navigate life's adventures, supporting and growing with each other. I also delight in going on walks or taking naps with my furry companion, diving into the world of video games, and experimenting with ingredients to cook up delicious meals in the kitchen.</p>

    <p>Life is an exciting journey, and I find fulfillment in the diverse experiences that both work and personal interests bring. Thanks for checking out my very first website!</p>
