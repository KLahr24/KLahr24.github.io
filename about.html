        <h2>Welcome to my About Page!</h2>
        <p>
            I am Katlin Lahr, and this is a bit about me. I am currently a junior at at Kennesaw State University
		working towards my bachelors degree in information technology. I work for the DPH as their data management supervisor
		and I really enjoy it! When I am not working or studying I like to spend time with my family. Other things I enjoy
		include teaching my dog new tricks, playing video games and cooking delicous meals.
